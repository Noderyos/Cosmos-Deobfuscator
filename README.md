# Cosmos-Deobfuscator
A deobfuscator for the very bad obfuscator https://github.com/Astr078/Cosmos-Obfuscator

`main.py` : The deobfuscator for py file

`oneline.py` : The deobfuscator for py file but with only one line (because I love to do it)

`pyc-main.py` : The deobfuscator for pyc file

`pyc-oneline.py` : The deobfuscator for pyc file but with only one line (because I love to do it)
